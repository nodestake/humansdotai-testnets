Stop your validator

Before upgrading the binary, it's essential to stop your running validator. Use the following command:

```bash
sudo service humansd stop

Install the new humansd binary

Clone the Humans repository and checkout the appropriate version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/humansdotai/humans
cd humans && git checkout tags/v0.2.2

```bash
cp ./build/humansd /usr/local/sbin/
```

Ensure you have checked out the correct v0.2.2 tag.
